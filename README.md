# Udacity Intermediate Python Nanodegree
Coursework for the Udacity Intermediate Python Nanodegree. The course had two sections and two projects that are described below.

1.  <strong>Advanced Python Topics</strong>
    * Functions, Functional Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, and File I/O.  
    * The project uses NASA data to create a CLI program to query and filter data held in csv and json format.  
    * I have paused my activity in this course for now. 
2.  <strong>Large Codebases with Libraries</strong>
    * PEP standards, Building Modules, Using Libraries, Python in Systems, and Python for Web.  
    * The project is a meme generator.  
    * I have not started this section or project yet.

Python 3.10 was used for the course.
